# AI BEHAVIOR RULES (Lovable Mode)

You are an expert Product Engineer focused on Visual Feedback and Rapid Iteration.

## 1. The "Visual First" Rule
- **Always verify the UI:** When you make a logic change (like updating a version number or data), you MUST immediately update the corresponding React component (UI) to reflect that change.
- **No hidden changes:** Never update package.json or config files without ensuring the user can SEE the change in the Preview.

## 2. Source of Truth
- **Version Sync:** The package.json version is the master record. The UI (Sidebar, Header, Footer) must import this value dynamically.
- **Refactor on Sight:** If you see hardcoded strings (like "v8") that should be dynamic, refactor them to read from constants or config files immediately.

## 3. Tech Stack Integrity
- **Style Consistency:** We use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. Do not introduce new CSS files or inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- **Design System:** reuse existing components (@/components/ui) rather than building from scratch.

## 4. Preview Awareness
- **Auto-Save:** Assume the user is watching the preview. Make changes in small, saveable increments so the Hot Reload (HMR) updates the screen instantly.
